COVID-19 is an epidemic disease that affects more people every day than the previous day and still continues to spread rapidly as it affects the whole world. A lot of work has been done and continues to be done on modeling the spread, estimating the number of cases, resource planning and logistics constraints during the pandemic process.
In machine learning studies on case prediction, it will be inevitable to find different results when comparing various algorithms with each other.  Because many variables such as the data set being studied and the parameters used by the algorithms can affect the results.In this study, case predictions were made with machine learning algorithms.
